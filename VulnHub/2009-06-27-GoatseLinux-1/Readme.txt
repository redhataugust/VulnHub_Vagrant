GoatseLinux v1.0 pentest lab Virtual Machine

Feel free to distribute this far and wide under the gnu license.
This is specifically built for VMware 6.5 compatibility. 

WARNING: GoatseLinux is intentionally unsecure. It was designed as a laboratory box to practice penetration testing on. Due to the wide open nature of nearly every program installed on it, I would strongly advise against setting your VM network to anything other than "host-based," unless you enjoy your VMs being used as zombie spamboxes.

Notes:

Built on the Slax 5.0.7 distro.
