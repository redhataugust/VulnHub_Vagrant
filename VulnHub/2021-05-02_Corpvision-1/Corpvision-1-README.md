    Corpvision - Vision to your Future
    Corpvision is a Company that hired Steven Smith, A Web Developer to create their website and now they hired you to test the security of their website. So Get, Set, and Go :)
    Difficulty: Beginner to Intermediate
    Tested On: Works well on VirtualBox, haven't tested on any other platforms.
    Facing any issue or any suggestions, hit me up on Twitter at twitter/@thehackersbrain.
    This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware

RedHatAugust Notes:
    I could not get this one to build into a vagrant box. Reached out to the author and waiting for a response.
