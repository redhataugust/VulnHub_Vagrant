Pretty much thought of a pretty neat idea I hadn't seen done before with a VM, and I wanted to turn it into reality!

Your job is to escalate to root, and find the flag.

Since I've gotten a few PM's, remember: There is a difference between "Port Unreachable" and "Host Unreachable". DHCP is not broken ;)

Gotta give a huge shoutout to c0ne for helping to creating the binary challenge, and rasta_mouse and recrudesce for testing :)

Also, gotta thank barrebas who was able to find a way to make things easier... but of course that is fixed with this update! ;)
