Difficulty:

Beginner
Description:

Mr. Derp and Uncle Stinky are two system administrators who are starting their own company, DerpNStink. Instead of hiring qualified professionals to build up their IT landscape, they decided to hack together their own system which is almost ready to go live...
Instructions:

This is a boot2root Ubuntu based virtual machine. It was tested on VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation12 using DHCP settings for its network interface. It was designed to model some of the earlier machines I encountered during my OSCP labs also with a few minor curve-balls but nothing too fancy. Stick to your classic hacking methodology and enumerate all the things!

Your goal is to remotely attack the VM and find all 4 flags eventually leading you to full root access. Don't forget to #tryharder

Example: flag1(AB0BFD73DAAEC7912DCDCA1BA0BA3D05). Do not waste time decrypting the hash in the flag as it has no value in the challenge other than an identifier.
