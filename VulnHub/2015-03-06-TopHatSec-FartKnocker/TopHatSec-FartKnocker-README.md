Description:
New VM challenge that should be fun for people trying to get into packet analysis!

There are several steps to this box. I created it with virtualbox. The VM is built on:

Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit

If you beat the box then please shoot me an email! Have fun guys!

P.S. I got the word "Fart Knocker" from watching beavis and butthead back in the day. Otherwise you kids might not understand :)
You may have issues when importing to VMware. If this is the case. extract the HDD from the OVA file (using something like 7zip), and attach to a new VM. Please see the following guide: https://jkad.github.io/blog/2015/04/12/how-to-import-the-top-hat-sec-vms-into-vmware/.
