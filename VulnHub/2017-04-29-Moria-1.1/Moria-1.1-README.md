| DESCRIPTION:                                            |
| Moria is NOT a beginner-oriented Boot2Root VM, it will  |
| require good enum skills and a lot of persistence.      |
|                                                         |
| VM has been tested on both VMware and VirtualBox, and   |
| gets its IP through DHCP, make sure you're on the same  |
| network.                                                |
|                                                         |
