Description:
'hackme' is a beginner difficulty level box. The goal is to gain limited privilege access via web vulnerabilities and subsequently privilege escalate as root. The lab was created to mimic real life environment.

'hackme' uses DHCP and in the possible event that the mysqld shuts down on its own (very rare cases), attempt to force restart the machine and it should be working fine subsequently.
This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
