Description:
Hacker House are community sponsors at this year’s BSides London 2017 and, to celebrate, we have an exploit challenge for you. A key date in the UK security scene, it offers an alternative technical conference for the hackers and tech geeks to share war stories and learn. We are providing a challenge lab designed especially for the conference that attendees can sink disassemblers into. If you aren’t at the event, you can also hack along at home, but remember that prizes for solutions can only be claimed at our stand during the event! The challenge is provided in ISO format which you can boot in VirtualBox or any similar virtualisation software, heck you can even run it on an ATM if you like, but this is unsupported. If you solve our little brain teasing conundrums and beat the system to get root, the first three successful solutions presented to us at our stand can claim one of our awesome hoodies, check them out in our shop! This challenge is open to individuals, but if you do decide to team up, then let us know as only one prize can be claimed per solution. We are also giving several t-shirts away during the raffle so make sure you get your tickets!

Our challenge will test your elite hacking skills and requires web application, reverse engineering, cryptography and exploit abilities. It shouldn’t take the competent skilled hacker too much time, but if you do struggle then watch our social media feeds during the event for some tips to this adventure. You should run the challenge in Host-Only networking mode and on successful boot you will be presented with a console, similar to the one shown at the end of this post. You should solve the challenge from a network perspective, only solutions using this route will be accepted for prizes (unless they are really cool!).

The goal of the challenge is to hack the ISO, level up your skills and get root, come and show us how you did it if you want to claim your prize! If you are struggling with the configuration of our challenge, you can check out our training course free module, which details steps for configuring a similar lab. You can find details and upcoming dates of our training here.

Happy hacking and remember sharing is caring so post (tweet us @myhackerhouse!) or email a solution and let us know about it after the event. We will share links to the best of them on this blog! May the force be with you, young padawan, and remember that hacking isn’t just a skill – it’s a survival trade.
