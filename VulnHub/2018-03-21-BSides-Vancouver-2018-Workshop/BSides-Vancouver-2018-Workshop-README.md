Description:
Boot2root challenges aim to create a safe environment where you can perform real-world penetration testing on an (intentionally) vulnerable target.

This workshop will provide you with a custom-made VM where the goal is to obtain root level access on it.

This is a great chance for people who want to get into pentesting but don’t know where to start. *

If this sounds intimidating, don’t worry! During the workshop, we’ll be discussing various methodologies, common pitfalls and useful tools at every step of our pentest.

Requirements:

    Laptop capable of running two VMs and has a USB port.
    At least 20GB of free space.
    VirtualBox pre-installed.
    Kali VM
    Some familiarity with CLI.
