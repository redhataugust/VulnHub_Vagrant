Requirements/starting guide:

    OVA file is compatible with Oracle Virtualbox and Vmware
    The challenge vm needs 1 cpu and 1512mb RAM to work properly
    The challenge vm has its network configured by default as bridge. It will take an IP from the DHCP of your network

Downloading challenge CTF vm:

    Download Link 1 (Mega)
    Mirror 1 (Dropbox)

Troubleshooting

    Vmware:
    If you get a warning/error importing machine, press "Retry" and it will be imported flawlessly
    Oracle Virtualbox
    It's recommended to use "Import Appliance" menu option instead of double click on OVA file
    If you get an error regarding network, just select your network interface

Good luck, the old gods and the new will protect you!
