About Release:
    Name: Mission-Pumpkin v1.0: PumpkinFestival
    Date release: 17 Jul 2019
    Author: Jayanth
    Series: Mission-Pumpkin v1.0

Description:
Mission-Pumpkin v1.0 is a beginner level CTF series, created by keeping beginners in mind. This CTF series is for people who have basic knowledge of hacking tools and techniques but struggling to apply known tools. I believe that machines in this series will encourage beginners to learn the concepts by solving problems.

PumpkinFestival is Level 3 of series of 3 machines under Mission-Pumpkin v1.0. The Level 1 ends by accessing PumpkinGarden_Key file. Level 2 is about identifying pumpkin seeds.

In this level (Level 3) it is time for Pumpkin Festival, the goal is to reach root and access PumpkinFestival_Ticket and collect PumpkinTokens on the way.
