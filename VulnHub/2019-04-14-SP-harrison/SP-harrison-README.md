    Name: SP: harrison
    Date release: 14 Apr 2019
    Author: Daniel Solstad
    Series: SP

Description:
Can you break free from Harrison's prison?

Flags - /root/flag.txt

Tested with VirtualBox

DHCP enabled

Difficulty: Intermediate

Should not be as easy as to just run a MSF module to get root right away, if so please let me know.
Doesn't always get an IP address nicely with DHCP.

Vagrant box made by RedHatAugust
Notes:
  - If the IP address isn't picked up, just reboot the machine
  - If there are no ports that are open in your scan, just wait a couple minutes and try again.
