    Series: 2much

Description:
2Much was made for pen-testing practice. When I worked on it, it hit me; Wouldn't be great to have an extra vulnerability on the host itself? As an extra bonus? It is at medium level difficulty. Enumeration is the key.

The vm contains both user and root flags. If you don’t see them, you need to try harder…

Built and tested on VMWare ESXi and Fusion.

DHCP-client

This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware.
