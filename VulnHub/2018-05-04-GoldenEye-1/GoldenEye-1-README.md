About Release:
    Name: GoldenEye: 1
    Date release: 4 May 2018
    Author: creosote
    Series: GoldenEye

Description:
I recently got done creating an OSCP type vulnerable machine that's themed after the great James Bond film (and even better n64 game) GoldenEye. The goal is to get root and capture the secret GoldenEye codes - flag.txt.

I'd rate it as Intermediate, it has a good variety of techniques needed to get root - no exploit development/buffer overflows. After completing the OSCP I think this would be a great one to practice on, plus there's a hint of CTF flavor.

I've created and validated on VMware and VirtualBox. You won't need any extra tools other than what's on Kali by default. Will need to be setup as Host-Only, and on VMware you may need to click "retry" if prompted, upon initially starting it up because of formatting.
