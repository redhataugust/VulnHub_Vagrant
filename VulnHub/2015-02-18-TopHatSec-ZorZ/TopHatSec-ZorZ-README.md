Description:
ZORZ is another VM that will challenge your webapp skills. There are 3 separate challenges (web pages) on this machine. It should be pretty straight forward. I have explained as much as I can in the readme file:

Welcome to the ZorZ VM Challenge

This machine will probably test your web app skills once again. There are 3 different pages that should be focused on (you will see!) If you solve one or all three pages, please send me an email and quick write up on how you solved each challenge. Your goal is to successfully upload a webshell or malicious file to the server. If you can execute system commands on this box, thats good enough!!! I hope you have fun!

You may have issues when importing to VMware. If this is the case. extract the HDD from the OVA file (using something like 7zip), and attach to a new VM. Please see the following guide: https://jkad.github.io/blog/2015/04/12/how-to-import-the-top-hat-sec-vms-into-vmware/.
