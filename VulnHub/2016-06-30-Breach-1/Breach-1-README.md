About Release:
    Name: Breach: 1
    Date release: 30 Jun 2016
    Author: mrb3n
    Series: Breach

Description:
First in a multi-part series, Breach 1.0 is meant to be beginner to intermediate boot2root/CTF challenge. Solving will take a combination of solid information gathering and persistence. Leave no stone unturned.

The VM is configured with a static IP address (192.168.110.140) so you will need to configure your host-only adaptor to this subnet.

Many thanks to knightmare and rastamouse for testing and providing feedback.

Shout-out to g0tmi1k for maintaining #vulnhub and hosting my first challenge.

If you run into any issues, you can find me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mrb3n813 or on IRC in #vulnhub.

Looking forward to the write-ups, especially any unintended paths to local/root.

Note, you may need to use 7zip to extract the ZIP.
