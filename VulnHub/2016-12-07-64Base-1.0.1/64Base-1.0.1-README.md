Description:
64Base Boot2Root

This is my very first public Boot2Root, It’s intended to be more of a fun game than a serious hacking challenge. Hopefully anyone interested enough to give it a try will enjoy the story with this one.

It is based on the StarWars storyline and is designed to Troll you in a fun way.

Just be warned, it’s littered with more than a few “Red Herrings” ;D
Difficulty Rating
