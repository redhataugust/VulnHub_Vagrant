About Release:
    Name: digitalworld.local: MERCY v2
    Date release: 28 Dec 2018
    Author: Donavan
    Series: digitalworld.local

Description:
MERCY is a machine dedicated to Offensive Security for the PWK course, and to a great friend of mine who was there to share my sufferance with me. :-)

MERCY is a name-play on some aspects of the PWK course. It is NOT a hint for the box.

If you MUST have hints for this machine (even though they will probably not help you very much until you root the box!): Mercy is: (#1): what you always plead for but cannot get, (#2): a dubious machine, (#3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-5UnMdKg70

Note: Some report a kernel privilege escalation works on this machine. If it does, try harder! There is another vector that you should try!
