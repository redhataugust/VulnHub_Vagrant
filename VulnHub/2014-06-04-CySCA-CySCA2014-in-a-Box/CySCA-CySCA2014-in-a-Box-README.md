Description:
CySCA2014-in-a-Box is a Virtual Machine that contains most of the challenges faced by players during CySCA2014. It allows players to complete challenges in their own time, to learn and develop their cyber security skills. The VM includes a static version of the scoring panel with all challenges, required files and flags.

To use CySCA2014 in a box virtual machines, players will need to have either Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Player installed on their machines. Additionally we recommend players have at least 4GB of RAM. If you have less RAM, you can reduce the amount of RAM available to the VM down to 512MB, however it may adversely affect the speed of some of the challenges.

CAUTION The VM contains software that is deliberately vulnerable. We advise that you do not attach it to a critical network. Consider using your virtualisation softwares host-only network functionality.
