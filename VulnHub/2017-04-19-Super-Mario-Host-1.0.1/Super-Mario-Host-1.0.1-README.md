Description

Welcome to Super Mario Host!

This VM is meant to be a simulation of a real world case scenario.

The goal is to find the 2 flags within the VM. Root is not enough (sorry!)

The VM can be exploited in various ways, but remember that Enumeration is the key.

The level of the challenge is Intermediate.

Thanks to vdbaan, kltdwd, mrb3n and GKNSB for testing.
