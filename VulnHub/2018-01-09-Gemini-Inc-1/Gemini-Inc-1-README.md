Name: Gemini Inc v1

Date release: 2018-01-09

Author: 9emin1

Series: Gemini Inc
Description:

I have decided to create vulnerable machines that replicate the vulnerabilities and difficulties I’ve personally encountered during my last year (2017) of penetration testing.

Some of the vulnerabilities require the “Think out of the box (fun)” mentality and some are just plain annoyance difficulties that require some form of automation to ease the testing.

GeminiInc v1 has been created that replicate an issue that I’ve encountered which was really interesting and fun to tackle, I hope it will be fun for you guys as well.

Adding a little made-up background story to make it more interesting...
Introduction:

Gemini Inc has contacted you to perform a penetration testing on one of their internal system. This system has a web application that is meant for employees to export their profile to a PDF. Identify any vulnerabilities possible with the goal of complete system compromise with root privilege. To demonstrate the level of access obtained, please provide the content of flag.txt located in the root directory as proof.

Filename: Gemini-Pentest-v1.zip

File size: 3283684247

SHA 1: 47ca8fb27b9a4b59aa6c85b8b1fe4df564c19a1e
Virtual Machine:

Format: Virtual Machine (VMWare)

Operating System: Debian
Networking:

DHCP Service : Enabled

IP Address: Automatically Assigned

More information can be obtained from my blog post on this vulnerable machine: https://scriptkidd1e.wordpress.com/

Intended solution will be provided some time after this has been published: https://scriptkidd1e.wordpress.com/geminiinc-v1-vm-walkthrough/

The VM has been tested on the following platform and is working:

    Mac OSX VMWare Fusion
    Windows 10 VMWare Player
    Windows 10 VMWare Workstation

It should work with any virtual machine player as well. It will be able to obtain an I.P Address with DHCP so no additional configuration is required. Simply import the downloaded VM and you are good to go.
