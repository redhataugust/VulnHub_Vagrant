Description:
Recently, Good Tech Inc. has decided to change their application development process. However, their applications look broken and too basic. Is this an application full of snakeoil, or are they insecure too? This goes beyond PEN-200, and some web application development expertise could be helpful.

If you MUST have hints for this machine: SNAKEOIL is (#1): a hint by itself, (#2): full of disallowed methods, (#3): a single file full of problems.
