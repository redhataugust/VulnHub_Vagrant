    Series: Violator

Description:
Welcome to another boot2root / CTF this one is called Violator. The VM is set to grab a DHCP lease on boot. As with my previous VMs, there is a theme, and you will need to snag the flag in order to complete the challenge.

A word of warning: The VM has a small HDD so you can brute force, but please set the disk to non persistent so you can always revert.

Some hints for you:

    Vince Clarke can help you with the Fast Fashion.
    The challenge isn't over with root. The flag is something special.
    I have put a few trolls in, but only to sport with you.

Many thanks to BenR and GKNSB for testing this CTF.
