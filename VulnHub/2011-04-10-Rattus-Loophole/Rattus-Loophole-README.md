Description:
Hi everyone!

Recently I've created my own Live CD and would like to get some feedback from you. This Live CD, codename Loophole, is meant to show you how important it is to keep your software up to date and properly configured. There's more than one way into the system and each one of them will teach you different network/computer security related topics.
Scenario for Loophole Live CD:

We suspect that someone inside Rattus labs is working with known terrorist group. Your mission is to infiltrate into their computer network and obtain encrypted document from one of their servers. Our inside source has told us that the document is saved under the name of Private.doc.enc and is encrypted using OpenSSL encryption utility. Obtain the document and decrypt it to complete the mission.
