Vagrant box made by RedHatAugust
Notes:
   Not all of these are machines. Download the respective files in the folders that do not have the Vagrantfile to check out that challenge. The ISO files are included in the Vagrant boxes, so please attach those if they aren't already. If you soft shut the machines, that ISO will be removed. If you pull all machines, they'll be in the same grouping of Exploit-Exercises-Mainsequence-v1.
