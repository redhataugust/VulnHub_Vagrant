Description:
In general, Iâ€™ve found that information is much easier to retain if it can be applied in the real world. Not everyone is a self-proclaimed botnet hunter, and it is not suggested (or recommended) that anyone try to exploit live botnets. For these reasons, I have put together another vulnerable virtual machine, which allows for aspiring botnet hunters and security enthusiasts to try their hand at attacking a Dexter command and control panel. It can be downloaded
