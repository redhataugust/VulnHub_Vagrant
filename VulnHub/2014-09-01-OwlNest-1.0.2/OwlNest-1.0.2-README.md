Welcome to The Owl Nest Owls are lovely but hates you :) and maybe after this one, you will hate them too.

Notes from the author: I hope you will enjoy this game, i spent a fairly high amount of effort to build this, in an attempt to make the game funny, and provide an avarage amount of frustration to the players :) Even if the machine was tested, maybe there are shortcuts to reach the flag.. hopefully not :)

Expect some curve balls :)

Special thanks goes to Barrebas for testing the VM
