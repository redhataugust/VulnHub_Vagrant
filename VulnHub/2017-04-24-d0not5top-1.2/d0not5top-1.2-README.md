Description:
D0Not5top Boot2Root

This is my second public Boot2Root, It’s intended to be a little more difficult that the last one I made. That being said, it will depend on you how hard it is :D It's filled with a few little things to make the player smile.

Again there are a few “Red Herrings”, and enumeration is key.

DIFFICULTY ?????

CAPTURE THE FLAGS
There are 7 flags to collect, designed to get progressively more difficult to obtain
