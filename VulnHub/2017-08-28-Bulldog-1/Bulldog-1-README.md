About Release:
    Name: Bulldog: 1
    Date release: 28 Aug 2017
    Author: Nick Frichette
    Series: Bulldog

Description:
Bulldog Industries recently had its website defaced and owned by the malicious German Shepherd Hack Team. Could this mean there are more vulnerabilities to exploit? Why don't you find out? :)

This is a standard Boot-to-Root. Your only goal is to get into the root directory and see the congratulatory message, how you do it is up to you!

Difficulty: Beginner/Intermediate, if you get stuck, try to figure out all the different ways you can interact with the system. That's my only hint ;)

I'd highly recommend running this on Virtualbox, I had some issues getting it to work in VMware. Additionally DHCP is enabled so you shouldn't have any troubles getting it onto your network. It defaults to bridged mode, but feel free to change that if you like.
