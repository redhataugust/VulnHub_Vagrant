Notes

    DHCP (Automatically assigned)
    IMPORTANT: The vm IS working as intended if you receive a successful DHCP lease as seen in the boot up sequence.
    The Necromancer VM MUST be on the same subnet as the attacking machine. Ideally both the boot2root VM and the attacking machine should be on the same HostOnly network. If you choose to use a physical box as the attacking machine, the boot2root VM must exist on the same network via a bridged interface.
