DVL Strychnine is finally final. The last pre-compilation is running at the moment, then the final compilation of the remaster will follow. Some nasty bugs fixed such as permissions problems of the pre-installed MySQL database containing first vulnerabe web examples. Click on the link below to see the current changelog. This shows you which additions have been added to the â€œclassicâ€ BT 2.0 release to build the base of the new era of Damn Vulnerable Linux. Some more minor unimportant features are left to install, however I believe it is time to go with the release to concentrate finally on the production of the most important: training lessons!

DVL Strychnine will be available via BitTorrent this weekend (never published before using BitTorrent! let's see if I run into problems!) - Later I place it on the mirrors. File size at the moment 822 MB, sorry for that but let the community decide what to kill!

A short intro video will follow soon, maybe I can make it this weekend.
