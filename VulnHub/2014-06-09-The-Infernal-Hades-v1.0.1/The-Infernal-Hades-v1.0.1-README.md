Description:
Infernal: Hades v1.0.1.

Hades is a new boot2root challenge pitched at the advanced hobbyist. Solving this challenge will require skills in reverse engineering, sploit development and sound computer architecture understanding. If you've never heard of an opaque predicate, you're going to have a hard time of it!

I strongly suggest you don't start this the week before exams, important meetings, deadlines of any sort, marriages, etc.

The aim of this challenge is for you to incrementally increase your access to the box until you can escalate to root. The /root/flag.txt contains, amongst other things, a public PGP key which you can use to demonstrate victory - the private key has been given to the VulnHub.com admins.

Enjoy, Lok_Sigma
Notes

    I have verified this challenge is completable using 'Kali 3.7-trunk-686-pae' (Kali Linux 1.0.5 x86) as my attack platform with VMware Fusion 5.
    It's meant to be hard.
    EDB is your friend.
    Hades will get an IP address by DHCP.
