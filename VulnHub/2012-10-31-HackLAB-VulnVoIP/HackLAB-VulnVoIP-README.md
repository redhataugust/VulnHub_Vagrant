Description:
VulnVoIP is based on a relatively old AsteriskNOW distribution and has a number of weaknesses. The aim is to locate VoIP users, crack their passwords and gain access to the Support account voicemail.

Just to keep things interesting this particular disto also suffers from a known exploit from which it is relatively easy to gain a root shell. Once you've found the easy way, can you get root using a different method?

I've created these basic VoIP hacking training exercises as I found very limited resources online. Hopefully VulnVoIP will help others learn the basic fundamentals of VoIP hacking in a safe environment.
