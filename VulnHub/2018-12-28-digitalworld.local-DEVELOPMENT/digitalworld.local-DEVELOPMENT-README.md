    Series: digitalworld.local

Description:
This machine reminds us of a DEVELOPMENT environment: misconfigurations rule the roost. This is designed for OSCP practice, and the original version of the machine was used for a CTF. It is now revived, and made slightly more nefarious than the original.

If you MUST have hints for this machine (even though they will probably not help you very much until you root the box!): Development is (#1): different from production, (#2): a mess of code, (#3): under construction.

Note: Some users report the box may seem to be "unstable" with aggressive scanning. The homepage gives a clue why.
