Description:
Welcome to Droopy. This is a beginner's boot2root/CTF VM.

The VM is set to grab a DHCP lease on boot.

There's 2 hints I would offer you:

1.) Grab a copy of the rockyou wordlist.

2.) It's fun to read other people's email.

Special thanks and shout-outs go to Barrebas and Rasta_Mouse for testing, and g0tmi1k for advice and offering to host my first CTF.
