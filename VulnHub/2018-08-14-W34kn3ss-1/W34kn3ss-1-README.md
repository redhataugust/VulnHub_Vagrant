This machine was made for Jordan’s Top hacker 2018 CTF , we tried to make it simulate a real world attacks “as much as possible” in order to improve your penetration testing skills , also we but a little tricky techniques on it so you can learn more about some unique skills.

The machine was tested on vmware (player / workstation) and works without any problems , so we recommend to use VMware to run it , Also works fine using virtualbox.

Difficulty: Intermediate , you need to think out of the box and collect all the puzzle pieces in order to get the job done.
