About Release:
    Name: Teuchter: 0.3
    Date release: 3 Nov 2016
    Author: knightmare
    Series: Teuchter

Description:
Welcome to another boot2root / CTF this one is called Teuchter. The VM is set to grab a DHCP lease on boot. As with my previous VMs, there is a theme, and you will need to snag the flag in order to complete the challenge. Less hochmagandy and more studying is needed for this one!

A word of warning: The VM has a small HDD so please set the disk to non persistent so you can always revert. You may need to set the MAC to 00:0C:29:65:D0:A0 too.

Hints for you:

    This VM is designed to be a bit of a joke/troll so a translator might be useful.
    The challenge isn't over with root. I've done my usual flag shenanigans.
    A bit of info security research and knowing your target helps here.
