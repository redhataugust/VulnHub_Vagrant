Description:
ctf8.zip contains the compressed virtual machine target (ctf8.vmdk) as well as the PDF walk through instructions.

The latest release fixes some issues with the user cron jobs that check their mail. Earlier versions were prone to memory leaks that would cause the virtualmachine to crash unexpectedly.
