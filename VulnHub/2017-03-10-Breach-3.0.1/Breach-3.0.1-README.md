About Release:
    Name: Breach: 3.0.1
    Date release: 10 Mar 2017
    Author: mrb3n
    Series: Breach

Description:
Third in a multi-part series, Breach 3.0 is a slightly longer boot2root/CTF challenge which attempts to showcase a few real-world scenarios/vulnerabilities, with plenty of twists and trolls along the way.

Difficulty: Intermediate, requires some creative thinking and persistence more so than advanced exploitation.

The VM is configured to grab a lease via DHCP.

A few things:

1) This is the culmination of the series, keep your notes close from the previous 2 challenges, they may come in handy. 2) Remember that recon is an iterative process. Make sure you leave no stone unturned. 3) The VM uses KVM and QEMU for virtualization. It is not necessary to root every host to progress. 4) There are 3 flags throughout, once you reach a flag you have achieved that intended level of access and can move on. These 3 flags are your objectives and it will be clear once you have found each and when it is time to move on.

Shout-out to knightmare for many rounds of testing and assistance with the final configuration as well as g0blin, Rand0mByteZ, mr_h4sh and vdbaan for testing and providing valuable feedback. As always, thanks to g0tmi1k for hosting and maintaining Vulnhub.
