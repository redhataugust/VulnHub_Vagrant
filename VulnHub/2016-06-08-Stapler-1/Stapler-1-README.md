| + Average beginner/intermediate VM, only a few twists   |
|   + May find it easy/hard (depends on YOUR background)  |
|   + ...also which way you attack the box                |
|                                                         |
| + It SHOULD work on both VMware and Virtualbox          |
|   + REBOOT the VM if you CHANGE network modes           |
|   + Fusion users, you'll need to retry when importing   |
|                                                         |
| + There are multiple methods to-do this machine         |
|   + At least two (2) paths to get a limited shell       |
|   + At least three (3) ways to get a root access        |
|                                                         |
