About Release:
    Name: Bulldog: 2
    Date release: 18 Jul 2018
    Author: Nick Frichette
    Series: Bulldog

Description:
Three years have passed since Bulldog Industries suffered several data breaches. In that time they have recovered and re-branded as Bulldog.social, an up and coming social media company. Can you take on this new challenge and get root on their production web server?

This is a Standard Boot-to-Root. Your only goal is to get into the root directory and see the congratulatory message, how you do it is up to you!

Difficulty: Intermediate, there are some things you may have never seen before. Think everything through very carefully :)

I'd highly recommend running this on VirtualBox. Additionally DHCP is enabled so you shouldn't have any troubles getting it onto your network. It defaults to bridged mode but feel free to change that if you like.
