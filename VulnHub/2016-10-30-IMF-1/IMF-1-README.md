Description:
Welcome to "IMF", my first Boot2Root virtual machine. IMF is a intelligence agency that you must hack to get all flags and ultimately root. The flags start off easy and get harder as you progress. Each flag contains a hint to the next flag. I hope you enjoy this VM and learn something.

Difficulty: Beginner/Moderate
