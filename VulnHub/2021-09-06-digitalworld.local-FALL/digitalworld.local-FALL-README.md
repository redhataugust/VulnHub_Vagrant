Description:
To celebrate the fifth year that the author has survived his infosec career, a new box has been born! This machine resembles a few different machines in the PEN-200 environment (making it yet another OSCP-like box). More enumeration practice indeed!

If you MUST have hints for this machine: FALL is (#1): what happens when one gets careless, (#2): important in making sure we can get up, (#3): the author's favourite season since it is a season of harvest.
