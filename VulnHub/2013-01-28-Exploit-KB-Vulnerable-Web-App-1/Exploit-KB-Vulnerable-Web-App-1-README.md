Description:
During my SQL Injection learning journey I needed a vulnerable web application for practice.

I created a WebApp vulnerable to SQL Injection for my personal use, The result was an extremely vulnerable web site which I could test some SQLi techniques against MySQL.

I must confess, I am not a programmer and I have never coded in PHP before, I thought it would be a good practice to develop a PHP based site from scratch in order to learn the basic of PHP and MySQL.

exploit.co.il Vulnerable Web app designed as a learning platform to test various SQL injection Techniques and it is a fully functional web site with a content management system based on fckeditor.

I thought some of you may find it useful so i decided to share it via a SourceForge project page i created for it at :

https://sourceforge.net/projects/exploitcoilvuln

Please notice! this web app is extremely vulnerable to SQLi attack and its poorly coded and configured intentionally.

It is not recommended to use this WebApp as live site on the net neither set it up on your local machine with access to it from the web.

Please use it in your internal LAN only, Set it up in a virtual environment such as VMware or Virtual Box.
