    Series: digitalworld.local

Description:
    2021 brings us the VENGEANCE of digitalworld.local! A box born out of COVID-19. This machine was built whilst the author was mulling over life in infosec whilst doing his PEN-300 course. But the author always has a heart for the OSCP, which explains yet another OSCP-like box, full of enumeration goodness.
    If you MUST have hints for this machine (even though they will probably not help you very much until you root the box!): VENGEANCE is (#1): all about users making use of other users, (#2): broken hearts, (#3): broken minds.
    Note: Always think like a user when enumerating target machine.
