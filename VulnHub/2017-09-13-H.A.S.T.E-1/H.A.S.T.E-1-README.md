Description:
This vulnerable-by-design box depicts a hacking company known as H.A.S.T.E, or Hackers Attack Specific Targets Expeditiously, capable of bringing down any domains on their hit list.

I would like to classify this challenge with medium difficulty, requiring some trial and error before a successful takeover can be attained.
