Description:
Eric is trying to reach out on the Internet, but is he following best practice?

Flags - /root/flag.txt - /home/eric/flag.txt

DHCP enabled

Difficulty: Beginner

Should not be as easy as to just run a MSF module to get root right away, if so please let me know.
Doesn't always get an IP address nicely with DHCP.
