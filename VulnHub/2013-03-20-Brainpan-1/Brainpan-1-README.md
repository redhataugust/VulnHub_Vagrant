DISCLAIMER
----------
By using this virtual machine, you agree that in no event will I be liable 
for any loss or damage including without limitation, indirect or 
consequential loss or damage, or any loss or damage whatsoever arising 
from loss of data or profits arising out of or in connection with the use 
of this software.

TL;DR: If something bad happens, it's not my fault.



SETUP
-----
Brainpan has been tested and found to work on the following hypervisors:
-    VMware Player 5.0.1
-    VMWare Fusion 5.0
-    VirtualBox 4.2.8

Import Brainpan into your preferred hypervisor and configure the network 
settings to your needs. It will get an IP address via DHCP, but it's 
recommended you run it within a NAT or visible to the host OS only since it
is vulnerable to attacks.
