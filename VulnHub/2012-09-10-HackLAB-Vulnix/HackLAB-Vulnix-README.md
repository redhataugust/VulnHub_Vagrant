    Architecture: x86
    Format: VMware (vmx & vmdk) compatibility with version 4 onwards
    RAM: 512MB
    Network: NAT
    Extracted size: 820MB

The goal; boot up, find the IP, hack away and obtain the trophy hidden away in /root by any means you wish – excluding the actual hacking of the vmdk
