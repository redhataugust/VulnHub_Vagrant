Description:
The goal of this challenge is to break into the machine via the web and find the secret hidden in a sensitive file. If you can find the secret, send me an email for verification. :)

There are a couple of different ways that you can go with this one. Good luck!

Simply download and import the OVA file into virtualbox!
You may have issues when importing to VMware. If this is the case. extract the HDD from the OVA file (using something like 7zip), and attach to a new VM. Please see the following guide: https://jkad.github.io/blog/2015/04/12/how-to-import-the-top-hat-sec-vms-into-vmware/.
