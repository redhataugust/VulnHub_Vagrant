Description:
I always enjoy creating and releasing vulnerable virtual machines so readers can get a first hand feel of attacking these command and control panels without doing anything illegal. The objective of this vulnerable virtual machine is to get a root shell. The root credentials (for network configuration purposes) are root:password. These credentials are not part of a solution and it is intended that the vulnerable virtual machine be attacked remotely. You can download the LoBOTomy vulnerable virtual machine here.
