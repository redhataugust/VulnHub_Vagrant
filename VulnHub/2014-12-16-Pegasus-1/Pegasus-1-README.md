Welcome to my first boot2root VM! Inspired by various CTF events I took part in and by couple cool concepts I learnt in the last couple months.

Rules of engagement are simple - find a way in, escalate your privileges all the way up to the root and get the flag!

As with all VMs like this, think outside the box, don't jump to conclusions too early and "read between the lines" :)

The VM has been tested on VMWare and VirtualBox, just import it, ensure the network is set as "Host Only" and run it. It should pick up the IP address automatically.

Enjoy! :)
