Have a look at the levels available on the side bar, and pick which ones interest you the most. If in doubt, begin at the start. You can log into the virtual machine with the username of "fusion" (without quotes), and password "godmode" (again, without quotes).

To get root for debugging purposes, do "sudo -s" with the password of "godmode".
