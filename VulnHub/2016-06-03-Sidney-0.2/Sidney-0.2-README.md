    Series: Sidney

Description:
Welcome to my third boot2root / CTF this one is called Sidney. The VM is set to grab a DHCP lease on boot. As before, gaining root is not the end of this VM. You will need to snag the flag, and being me, it's never where they normally live... B-)

If you are having trouble with the NIC, make sure the adapter is set to use the MAC 00:0C:29:50:14:56

Some hints for you:

    If you are hitting a wall, read https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502
    The flag is audio as well as visual
