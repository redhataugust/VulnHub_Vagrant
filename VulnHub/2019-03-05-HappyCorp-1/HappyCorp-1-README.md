| + Average beginner/intermediate VM, only a few twists   |
|   + May find it easy/hard (depends on YOUR background)  |
|   + ...also which way you attack the box                |
|                                                         |
| + It SHOULD work on VMware                              |
|   + REBOOT the VM if you CHANGE network modes           |
|   + Fusion users, you'll need to retry when importing   |
