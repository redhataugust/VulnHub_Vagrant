Holynix 1.0 beta Release Notes

Similar to the de-ice and pWnOS pentest cds, Holynix is an ubuntu server vmware image that was deliberately built to have security holes for the purposes of penetration testing. More of an obstacle course than a real world example. The object of the challenge is to gain root level privileges and access to personal client information.
