About Release:
    Name: Breach: 2.1
    Date release: 15 Aug 2016
    Author: mrb3n
    Series: Breach

Description:
Second in a multi-part series, Breach 2.0 is a boot2root/CTF challenge which attempts to showcase a real-world scenario, with plenty of twists and trolls along the way.

The VM is configured with a static IP (192.168.110.151) so you'll need to configure your host only adaptor to this subnet. Sorry! Last one with a static IP ;)

A hint: Imagine this as a production environment during a busy work day.

Shout-out to knightmare for many rounds of testing and assistance with the final configuration as well as rastamouse, twosevenzero and g0blin for testing and providing valuable feedback. As always, thanks to g0tmi1k for hosting and maintaining #vulnhub.

VirtualBox users: if the screen goes black on boot once past the grub screen make sure to go to settings ---> general, and make sure it says Type: Linux Version: Debian 64bit

If you run into any issues, you can find me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mrb3n813 or on IRC in #vulnhub.

Looking forward to the write-ups, especially any unintended paths to local/root.

Happy hunting!
