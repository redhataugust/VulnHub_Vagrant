    Series: Mission-Pumpkin v1.0

Description:
Mission-Pumpkin v1.0 is a beginner level CTF series, created by keeping beginners in mind. This CTF series is for people who have basic knowledge of hacking tools and techniques but struggling to apply known tools. I believe that machines in this series will encourage beginners to learn the concepts by solving problems. PumpkinGarden is Level 1 of series of 3 machines under Mission-Pumpkin v1.0. The end goal of this CTF is to gain access to PumpkinGarden_key file stored in the root account.
