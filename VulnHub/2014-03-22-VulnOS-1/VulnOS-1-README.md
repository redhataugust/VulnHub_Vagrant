Description:
Welcome to VulnOS !

This is my first vulnerable target I made because I want to give back something to the community. Big up for the community that made things possible!!!

Your goal is to get root and find all the vulnerabilities inside the OS ! It is a ubuntu server 10.04 LTS (that's been made very buggy!!!!) DO NOT USE This Box in a production environment!!!!!!! It's a VM thas has been made with Virtualbox 4.3.8 - so it's in the .vdi format.

Networking :

This box has been made with bridged networking and uses DHCP to get an IP address (was 192.168.1.66 when I built it). So it is best to share the attack OS and the TARGET BOX to IP-Range OF 192.168.1.1/24

Maybe you could set it up with m0n0wall and setup static IP-addresses.

If you cannot find the target's IP ADRERSS, contact me @ blakrat1 AT gmail DOT com I will give you the root user and password to login....

Hope you find this useful !!!
