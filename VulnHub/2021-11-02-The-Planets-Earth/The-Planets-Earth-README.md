    Series: The Planets

Description:
Difficulty: Easy

Earth is an easy box though you will likely find it more challenging than "Mercury" in this series and on the harder side of easy, depending on your experience. There are two flags on the box: a user and root flag which include an md5 hash. This has been tested on VirtualBox so may not work correctly on VMware. Any questions/issues or feedback please email me at: SirFlash at protonmail.com, though it may take a while for me to get back to you.
