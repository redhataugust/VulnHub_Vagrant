Description:
Welcome to the challenge.

This VM is designed to try and entertain the more advanced information security enthusiast. This doesn't exclude beginners however and I'm sure that a few of you could meet the challenge. There is no 'one' focus on the machine, a range of skills such as web exploitation, password cracking, exploit development, binary examination and most of all logical thinking is required to crack the box in the intended way - but who knows there might be some short cuts!

A few of the skills needed can be seen in some posts on http://netsec.ws. Otherwise enjoy the experience - remember that although vulnerabilities might not jump out at you straight away you may need to try some variations on the normal to get past the protections in place!

Feel free to discuss the experience on the #vulnhub irc channel on irc.freenode.net. If you want any hints feel free to PM my nick on there (Peleus). You won't get any, but I'll feel all warm and fuzzy inside knowing you're suffering.

Enjoy.
