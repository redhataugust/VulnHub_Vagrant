Description:
Oz was originally created and submitted to HackTheBox. It is a medium/hard boot2root challenge. The Oz box has 2 flags to find (user and root) and has a direct route for each, no need to bruteforce access. It is a slightly trolly box with real world vulnerabilities. The OVF has been tested on VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, and VMware Workstation.
