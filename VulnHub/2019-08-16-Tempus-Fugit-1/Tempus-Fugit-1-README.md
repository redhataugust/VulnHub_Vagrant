About Release:
    Name: Tempus Fugit: 1
    Date release: 16 Aug 2019
    Author: 4ndr34z & DCAU
    Series: Tempus Fugit

Description:
Tempus Fugit is a Latin phrase that roughly translated as “time flies”.

It is an intermediate real life box.

Created mostly by 4ndr34z with some assistance by DCAU, the idea behind Tempus Fugit was to create something “out of the ordinary” and without giving anything away, something “dynamic” and a lot like time... changing.

The vm contains both user and root flags. If you don’t see them, you are not looking in the right place...
