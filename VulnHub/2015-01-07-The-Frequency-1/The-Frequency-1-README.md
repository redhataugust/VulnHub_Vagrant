    Series: The Frequency

Description:
    Objective: gain shell access for each level. Then reach root.
    Note: figure out what the blips are, where they are, and how to decode each one.

Note, you may have issues running this depending on your host hardware. This is due to the guest OS being OpenBSD, and it being a bit more 'picky' on what it will run on when its been virtualized.
