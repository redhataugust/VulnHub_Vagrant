Description:
Tr0ll was inspired by the constant trolling of the machines within the OSCP labs.

The goal is simple, gain root and get Proof.txt from the /root directory.

Not for the easily frustrated! Fair warning, there be trolls ahead!

Difficulty: Beginner ; Type: boot2root

Special thanks to @OS_Eagle11 and @superkojiman for suffering through the testing all the way to root!

The machine should pull an IP using DHCP, if you have any problems, contact me for a password to get it to working.

Feedback is always appreciated!
