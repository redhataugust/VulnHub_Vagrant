    Description
    DC-9 is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
    The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the one and only flag.
    Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
    For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I won't give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.
    Technical Information
    DC-9 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 64 bit, but there shouldn't be any issues running it on most PCs.
    DC-9 has been tested successfully on VMWare Player, but if there are any issues running this VM in VMware, have a read through of this.
    It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
    Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox or VMWare and away you go.
    Important
    While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
    In saying that, there shouldn't be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
    Credits
    A big thanks goes out to the members of @m0tl3ycr3w.
