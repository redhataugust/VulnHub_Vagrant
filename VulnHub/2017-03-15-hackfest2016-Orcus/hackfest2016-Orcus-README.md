Description:
Welcome to Orcus

This is a vulnerable machine i created for the Hackfest 2016 CTF http://hackfest.ca/

Difficulty : Hard

Tips:

If youre stuck enumerate more! Seriously take each service running on the system and enumerate them more!

Goals: This machine is intended to take a lot of enumeration and understanding of Linux system.

There are 4 flags on this machine 1. Get a shell 2. Get root access 3. There is a post exploitation flag on the box 4. There is something on this box that is different from the others from this series (Quaoar and Sedna) find why its different.

Feedback: This is my third vulnerable machine, please give me feedback on how to improve ! @ViperBlackSkull on Twitter simon.nolet@hotmail.com

Special Thanks to madmantm for testing this machine
