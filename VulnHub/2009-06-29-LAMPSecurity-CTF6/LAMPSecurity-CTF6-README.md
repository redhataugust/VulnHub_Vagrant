Description:
The LAMPSecurity project is an effort to produce training and benchmarking tools that can be used to educate information security professionals and test products. Please note there are other capture the flag exercises (not just the latest one). Check the SourceForge site to find other exercises available (http://sourceforge.net/projects/lampsecurity/files/CaptureTheFlag/).

These exercises can be used for training purposes by following this documentation. Alternatively you may wish to test new tools, using the CTF virtual machines as targets. This is especially helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of vulnerability discovery or penetration testing tools.
