ABOUT

Persistence aims to provide you with challenging obstacles that block your path to victory. It is perhaps best described by quotes made by some famous people:

"A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success." - Calvin Coolidge

"Energy and persistence conquer all things." - Benjamin Franklin

"Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems." - Gever Tulley
